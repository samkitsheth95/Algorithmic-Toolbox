# Algorithmic-Toolbox
This repository contains my solutions for the assignments of the course - Algorithmic Toolbox offered on Coursera. It is part of Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization. All soulutions are only in Java. 

##### These solutions are for reference only, for passing the course design and implement your own solutions

##### About the course
The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).
